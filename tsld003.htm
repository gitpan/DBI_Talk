I’m sure other speakers are giving their reasons. These are some of mine:
</UL><UL>
If I had top give one reason: Fewer lines of code.
</UL><UL>
Higher level language =&#062 less code =&#062 less errors (Mythical Man Month)
</UL><UL>
=&#062 Consider “A picture is worth a thousand words” - rich in powerful idioms (compact but not so terse as to be unreadable later - like APL) vs “Can’t see the wood for the trees” - in other languages like C.
</UL><UL>
“No limits” - often hard to do in other languages where much more care/effort id required
</UL><UL>
Exception handling - simplifies logic - less code - less errors
</UL><UL>
Rapid prototyping
</UL><UL>
Rapid response to change - simply less code to maintain
</UL><UL>
Many free reusable modules
</UL><UL>

</UL><UL>
Perl is an approriate language for a very wide range of tasks.
</UL><UL>
Learning Perl often avoids the need to learn one or more other tools.</UL> </P>
