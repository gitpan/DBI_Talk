<H2>   SELECT * FROM t1, t2  WHERE t1.key=1 AND t2.key=2 AND t1.value=t2.value
</H2>

</UL><UL>
<LI><H2>One possible approach:
</H2>
<UL>
  Select from one table using its key field (assume both tables have an index on key)
<BR><BR>  Then, loop for each row returned, and...
<BR>	  select from the other table using its key field and the current row’s value field
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>But which table to select first?
</H2>
<UL>
  To keep it simple, assume that both tables have the same value in all rows
<BR></UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>If we know that t1.key=1 matches 1000 rows and t2.key=2 matches 1
</H2>
<UL>
then we know that we should select from t2 first
<BR><BR>because that way we only have to select from each table once
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>If we selected from t1 first
</H2>
<UL>
then we’d have to select from t2 1000 times!
<BR></UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>An alternative approach would be to select from both and merge
